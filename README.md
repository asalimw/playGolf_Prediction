# playGolf_Prediction
Machine learning application to predict whether or not to play golf based on Weather conditions.

Web App: https://asalimw.shinyapps.io/GolfDay/

This is a 5 web page presentation using R Markdown that features a Shiny Web App on “Golf Weather”.

There absolutely is such a thing as golf weather, although the specific spectrum of perfectly playable weather conditions depends on where you live and a vast majority of dedicated golfers love cooler weather with low humidity and no breeze (or just a little bit of a breeze).

The aim of this web app is to predict whether to play a game of golf in certain weather conditions. To achieve the objective we will be deploying a Machine Learning - Random Forest Model on the Golf|Weather Dataset.

Info on the Golf|Weather Data: https://datacadamia.com/data_mining/weather

How to achieve the objective:

1. Prepare Data 
2. Build Random Forest Model 
3. Design 4 tab panel user interface in the ui.R 
4. Perform test on the Random Forest model in the server.R for prediction 
5. The link to my code can be viewed on last page of the presentation
